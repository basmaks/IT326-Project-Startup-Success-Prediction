## Startup Success Prediction Model

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has emerged as an increasingly attractive hub for entrepreneurs looking to establish their startups. Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, presents a wealth of opportunities for both founders and investors to bring forth innovative solutions.

### Project Motivation 

Our **motivation** in building this model is for it to act as a guiding beacon for investors. When the model predicts the success of a startup, it becomes an attractive investment opportunity, ensuring that investors see a return on their investment. Conversely, if a startup is showing signs of potential failure and closure, it prompts investors to explore alternative investments.

### Goal

In this project, our **goal** is to build a predictive model capable of predicting the potential success of startups. We aspire to utilize the insights gained from this model to test and predict the possible success of startups within the region.

### General Information

The dataset comprises **20 columns** and **925 rows**.

The **class label** we are focusing on is "**status**," which distinguishes between **successful startups (labeled as "acquired")** and unsuccessful ones **(labeled as "closed")**.
