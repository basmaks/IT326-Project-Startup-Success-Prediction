## Startup Success Prediction Model

The "Startup Success Prediction" dataset provides a comprehensive record of startup companies, tracing their early-stage decisions, such as funding rounds, categories, and more, spanning the years from 1984 to 2010. Notably, the 'status' attribute serves as a vital indicator, shedding light on the outcome of these decisions, distinguishing between productive outcomes, often leading to company acquisitions, and less favorable results that resulted in business closures.

Our objective is to use preprocessing, classification, and clustering techniques to construct an accurate predictive model using Decision Trees. This model is designed to foresee the potential success (as indicated by the 'status' attribute) of startup companies. Such a tool holds immense promise, offering valuable insights to both investors and job seekers. It helps investors make smarter decisions by identifying startups with a higher chance of success. It also assists job seekers in finding promising companies for their careers. 


### Project Motivation 

Our **motivation** in building this model is for it to act as a guiding beacon for investors. When the model predicts the success of a startup, it becomes an attractive investment opportunity, ensuring that investors see a return on their investment. Conversely, if a startup is showing signs of potential failure and closure, it prompts investors to explore alternative investments.


### Goal

In this project, our **goal** is to build a predictive model capable of predicting the potential success of startups. We aspire to utilize the insights gained from this model to test and predict the possible success of startups within the region.



### General Information

The dataset comprises **50 columns** and **925 rows**.

The **class label** we are focusing on is "**status**", which distinguishes between **successful startups (labeled as "acquired")** and unsuccessful ones **(labeled as "closed")**.
