## Startup Success Prediction Model

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has emerged as an increasingly attractive hub for entrepreneurs looking to establish their startups. Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, presents a wealth of opportunities for both founders and investors to bring forth innovative solutions.

In this project, our **goal** is to build a predictive model capable of predicting the potential success of startups. In this dataset, the **class label** we are focusing on is "**status**," which distinguishes between **successful startups (labeled as "acquired") and unsuccessful ones (labeled as "closed")**. We aspire to utilize the insights gained from this model to test and predict the possible success of startups within the region.

**Students:** Basma Alsulaim â€“ Aafia Nawal Mohammed.
